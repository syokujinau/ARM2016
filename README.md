**NuMicro™ NUC130/NUC140**
-------------

The NuMicro™ NUC100 Series is 32-bit microcontrollers with embedded ARM® Cortex™-M0 core for industrial control and applications which need rich communication interfaces. The Cortex™-M0 is the newest ARM® embedded processor with 32-bit performance and at a cost equivalent to traditional 8-bit microcontroller. NuMicro™ NUC100 Series includes NUC100, NUC120, NUC130 and NUC140 product line. The NuMicro™ NUC130 Automotive Line with CAN function embeds Cortex™-M0 core running up to 50 MHz with 32K/64K/128K-byte embedded flash, 4K/8K/16K-byte embedded SRAM, and 4K-byte loader ROM for the ISP. It also equips with plenty of peripheral devices, such as Timers, Watchdog Timer, RTC, PDMA, UART, SPI, I2C, I2S, PWM Timer, GPIO, LIN, CAN, PS/2, 12-bit ADC, Analog Comparator, Low Voltage Reset Controller and Brown-out Detector.
